# Description of the project

In this assignment, you are asked to develop a marketing strategy for CreeqBoat. The assignment is based on the case description Boats (A): A Segmentation Case, with the kind permission of Prof. Theos Evgeniou from INSEAD. The relevant data is attached here and described within the appendix of the case. You are required to complete the following tasks:

1. Check the answers to Q.1 of the survey. In particular, create a correlation matrix of the answers to the 29 questions and discuss (i) whether there are any high correlations, and (ii) what these correlations imply.
2. Help Mary by conducting a principal component analysis in Python of the attitudinal data captured in Q.1 of the survey. In particular, answer (i) how many components to select - here you should justify your choice based on statistical, interpretation, and business arguments, and (ii) how to interpret the selected components.
3. Pick three customers and describe them, based on how they score on the components you have selected.
4. Use the customers' component scores to derive customer segments using Python. You can use either K-Means clustering or hierarchical clustering. Discuss scaling/normalization and whether it is sensible in this context. Also, make sure to specify the number of clusters you pick and justify your choice - again, based on statistical, interpretation, and business arguments.
5. Create a profile of your clusters (customer segments) using the answers to questions Q.2-Q.15 of the survey. In particular, use heat maps and snake plots to visualize how the different customer segments score on these questions. Based on this, describe the key features of each cluster.
6. Discuss how robust your results are to changes in the number of components selected. Make sure to rerun your analysis with at least two different choices of component numbers. There is no need to keep separate code and descriptions of each of these analyses, but you will need to describe how robust your segmentation results are and, if there are major changes when changing the number of components, discuss those.
7. Based on the segments you identify (and their likelihood of recommending and buying from CreeqBoat - Q.17 and Q.18 in the survey), what can you recommend CreeqBoat regarding the customer segments to target and the types of targeted boats to build?

# Deliverables

By December 8 (4pm), you are supposed to submit the following package:

- A notebook, containing all the code required to reproduce your analysis, as well as your textual answers. Make sure that you justify all of your answers.
- A slideshow with 3-5 slides that illustrates (i) the components you have identified through PCA, including their interpretation, (ii) the customer segments you derived, including their interpretation, and (iii) how the customer segments could inform CreeqBoat in building targeted boats.

# Assessment

Your submission will be evaluated against four criteria:

- appropriate use of concepts and frameworks discussed in class
- effectiveness of the proposed answer/solution
- originality and creativity of the proposed answer/solution
- organization and clarity of submitted materials
